# Project Context
# This file describes your system architecture. It is injected into every agent
# prompt as {{PROJECT_CONTEXT}} so agents understand how your repositories connect.
#
# Copy to project-context.txt and customize:
#   cp config/project-context.example.txt config/project-context.txt
#
# The init-project.sh script auto-generates this from your repos.conf.

## System Overview

This project consists of the following repositories:

### your-org/frontend (web)
- **Local path**: /home/you/code/frontend
- **Stack**: Next.js (React, TypeScript)

### your-org/backend (backend)
- **Local path**: /home/you/code/backend
- **Stack**: AWS CDK (TypeScript, Lambda, DynamoDB)

## Repository Relationships

<!-- EDIT THIS SECTION: Describe how your repos connect -->
<!-- Example: The frontend calls APIs defined in the backend repo -->
<!-- Example: The backend exposes REST endpoints consumed by both frontend and mobile -->

- The frontend calls REST APIs served by the backend's API Gateway
- Backend Lambda functions read/write to DynamoDB tables
- When an issue requires API changes, BOTH repos need updates

## Cross-Repo Implementation Rules

- If an issue requires changes in multiple repos, the triage agent should create separate sub-issues for each repo
- Frontend changes that need a new API endpoint must specify the API contract in the issue body
- Always read the relevant backend code before assuming an API endpoint exists or doesn't exist
