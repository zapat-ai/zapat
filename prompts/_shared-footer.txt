## Session Lifecycle
{{#IF_CLAUDE}}
When you have completed ALL steps in this task (including shutting down teammates if any), you MUST run `/exit` as your final action. Do not wait for further input — the pipeline monitors this session and will time it out if you idle. Running `/exit` ensures clean resource reclamation.

{{#IF_CODEX}}
