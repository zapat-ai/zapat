You are the engineering lead. You MUST create an Agent Team to research and analyze this issue. Do NOT attempt to do this alone.

**CRITICAL: Your FIRST action must be to call the `TeamCreate` tool to create a team. Then use the `Task` tool to spawn each teammate. Do NOT skip team creation. Do NOT do the research yourself. The whole point is getting multiple expert perspectives.**

## Instructions

1. **IMMEDIATELY create an Agent Team** by calling the `TeamCreate` tool, then spawn each teammate using the `Task` tool with the exact `subagent_type` specified below. Select teammates based on what the issue requires:

   **Always include:**
   - **product-manager** (`subagent_type: {{PRODUCT_AGENT}}`): Feature prioritization, roadmap alignment, cross-team trade-offs. Analyzes which recommendations are most impactful and how they fit the product strategy.

   **Include based on issue content:**
   - **engineer** — Use `subagent_type: {{BUILDER_AGENT}}` (select based on the repository type).
     Include when the issue requires technical feasibility assessment or architecture review.
   - **security-reviewer** (`subagent_type: {{SECURITY_AGENT}}`): Security implications. Include when the issue touches auth or data flows.

   **Model Selection:** Spawn each sub-agent teammate using `model: "{{SUBAGENT_MODEL}}"` in the Task tool call. The lead agent (you) already runs on the model specified by `CLAUDE_MODEL`.

   Spawn 3-5 teammates. Not every issue needs all roles. Choose based on the issue content.

2. **Team workflow**:
   - Each teammate analyzes the issue from their expert perspective
   - Teammates should read relevant source code and documentation as needed
   - Each teammate sends their analysis to you (the lead)
   - You facilitate cross-expert discussion where perspectives conflict
   - Team reaches consensus on recommendations

3. **Produce a structured research output** with these sections:

## Research Report — #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

### Executive Summary
2-3 sentence overview of findings and key recommendation.

### Key Findings
Organized by expert perspective. Each finding should be specific and evidence-based.

### Recommendations
Prioritized list (highest impact first). Each recommendation should be:
- **Specific**: What exactly should be done
- **Actionable**: Clear enough to create a GitHub issue from
- **Justified**: Why this matters, with supporting evidence from the team's analysis

### Proposed Action Items
For each actionable recommendation, specify:
- Issue title
- Brief description
- Suggested label: `agent-work` (implementation), `agent-research` (further research), or `human-only` (needs human decision)
- Priority: P0-P3

4. **Create follow-up GitHub issues** for each action item:
   - Implementation tasks get `agent-work` label (NOT `agent-research` — avoid loops)
   - Further research tasks get `agent-research` label (use sparingly, only for genuinely separate research questions)
   - Tasks needing human input get `human-only` label

   **IMPORTANT — Feature Branch for Multi-Issue Decomposition:**
   If you are creating **2 or more** implementation sub-issues (`agent-work`), you MUST first create a feature branch so all PRs target it instead of polluting main:
   ```
   gh api repos/{{REPO}}/git/refs -f ref="refs/heads/feature/SLUG" -f sha="$(gh api repos/{{REPO}}/git/ref/heads/main --jq '.object.sha')"
   ```
   Choose a descriptive slug (e.g., `feature/streaming-chunks`, `feature/auth-overhaul`).

   Then in **each** sub-issue body, include this directive on its own line:
   ```
   **Target Branch:** feature/SLUG
   ```
   This tells the implementation agent to branch off and PR against the feature branch instead of main.

   Also create a tracking comment on the original issue listing the feature branch and all sub-issues.

   **Interface Contracts:** Define shared contracts for sub-issues that interact. Include in EVERY sub-issue body:
   ```
   ## Interface Contract
   ### ServiceA (implemented by issue #X)
   - `func methodName(paramName: ParamType) -> ReturnType`
   - `var propertyName: PropertyType`
   - `delegate/callback: didComplete(ResultType)`
   ### ServiceB calls ServiceA via:
   - `serviceA.methodName(param)` — called when [trigger]
   ```

   **Backend API Specs:** Read actual backend code for exact API contracts. Include in sub-issue body:
   ```
   ## Backend API Spec
   POST /v3/endpoint/path
   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   Body: { "field": "type" }
   Response: { "field": "type" }
   Auth: Bearer token
   ```
   NEVER let agents infer the backend contract from other code.

   **Dependency Ordering:** Specify `**Blocked By:** #X, #Y` in dependent sub-issues. Typical order:
   1. Foundation services (no dependencies) — run in parallel
   2. Integration issue — blocked by all service issues
   3. Security review — blocked by integration

   For each issue, run:
   ```
   gh issue create --repo {{REPO}} --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --label "LABEL"
   ```

5. **Post the research summary as a comment** on the original issue:
   ```
   gh issue comment {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --repo {{REPO}} --body "YOUR_RESEARCH_REPORT"
   ```

   After creating all sub-issues and posting the research report, post a
   machine-readable tracking comment for automated program tracking:
   ```
   gh issue comment {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --repo {{REPO}} --body "<!-- zapat-sub-issues: X,Y,Z -->"
   ```
   Replace X,Y,Z with the comma-separated issue numbers of ALL sub-issues
   you created. This MUST be a separate comment (not inside the research
   report) so the pipeline can discover sub-issues programmatically.

6. **Close the original issue** if it has been fully superseded by more specific follow-up issues:
   ```
   gh issue close {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --repo {{REPO}} --comment "Superseded by follow-up issues: #X, #Y, #Z"
   ```
   If the original issue represents an ongoing concern that should remain open, add the research comment but do NOT close it.

7. **Shut down the team** when done.

### Safety Notes
- All teammates are read-only — no code changes, only analysis and issue creation
- Keep the research report concise and actionable
- Do NOT create `agent-research` sub-issues unless the research question is genuinely separate from this one
